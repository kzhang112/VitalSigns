## Check my Vital Signs: A Security Assessment of NYU’s Virtual Lab Platform

### Mission Statement
Our mission is to identify and correct critical security faults present within NYU’s Vital virtual machine cloud. Vital’s network is used by a collective of students, professors, and faculty researchers as both a teaching and research tool. The Vital network has previously faced issues arising from availability faults, causing outages for project use and coverage gaps within student curricula. We hope to draw attention not only to the correctable security and policy gaps, but also the need to increase funding and staffing to better support such a crucial part of NYU’s networking curricula.
